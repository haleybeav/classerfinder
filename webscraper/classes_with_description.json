Our study of this kind will be multidirectional rather than linear, as we trace our primary subjects to and from their world-historical contexts, for instance in Tsarist Russia, Iraq, Israel-Palestine, and Medieval Europe, in order to excavate divisive political positions and abstract poetic practices.

We will place great emphasis upon the presence of non-English language, multilingual, and migrant materials and thinkers.
